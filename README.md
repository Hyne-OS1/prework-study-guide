# Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I created this study guide in the hopes of gaining not only hands on knowledge but also providing an interactive tool for other users. 
Building this website from the ground up showed me the ins and outs of what goes into creating a website and its use of multiple coding languages (HTML, JavaScript, CSS,Git).
Each language has a few brief points on what you can not only expect from each area of study but also some things to look out for and be attentive to.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Using the study tool is quite easy, you can review some of the brief points on the starting page for each section. Should you wish to have a topic randomly selected on where you wish to start, using your chrome DevTools pressing command+option+I (MacOS) or Control+shift+I (Windows) you can inspect the study guide itself and generate yourself a starting topic.

You now have access to the full study guide! Being hands on and going over your code is essential to becoming familiar with everyday coding habits and is a great way to create a fluent routine for future use.
